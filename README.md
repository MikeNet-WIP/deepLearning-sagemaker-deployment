# SageMaker Deployment Project

This was a fun project, messed up and let it run for 3 days.... ~30$ AWS at time of development. 

The notebook and Python files provided here results in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. 

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the udacity directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks).
